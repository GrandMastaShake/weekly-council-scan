# The Testing Room

Where Council designs are tried against the weeks the real Council actually ran,
before anything changes in production.

## Rules

1. **Only weeks the Council ran.** A week is in scope if it has a Monday/Tuesday
   report and has closed. Every week therefore has a real Council book to compare
   against (an abort week counts, scored as the cash the Council actually held).
   The set grows by one each Monday.
2. **Point-in-time.** For the week opening Monday W, nothing dated W or later may
   reach a variant. Anything production reads "as of today" is replaced with what
   was knowable then. See the docstring in `engine_lab.py` for the full table.
3. **One scoring basis.** Monday open (first session on or after Monday) to Friday
   close, dividend-adjusted total return, cash earns zero. This is the same basis
   as the fixed `portfolio/tracker.py` and `scripts/arena_ingest.py`.
4. **Beat random first.** Every variant is scored against 200 random books drawn
   from the same universe at the same weights. A variant that cannot beat random
   picks has no selection signal, however good its reasoning reads.
5. **LLM passes stay after the training cutoff.** The Council's weeks (July 2026
   on) postdate the model's May 2026 training cutoff, so no LLM variant can
   recall how they went. Never extend an LLM pass to earlier weeks.
6. **Nine weeks is small.** Look for large, consistent effects and for failures
   with a clear mechanism. Do not tune parameters to these weeks and then
   report the same weeks as proof.

## Rooms

- **Engine Lab** -- `engine_lab.py`. The numeric engines, replayed as pure code.
- **Council Room** -- (Pass 2) the LLM layer: brief-first, separate passes,
  research-led, each fed the exact repo snapshot from Monday 08:50 of its week.

## Faithfulness of the Engine Lab replay

| Engine  | Faithful? | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Ophelia | yes | price-only; the lab differs from production only by the wiki nudge (at most +/-7 points) |
| Marky   | yes | price-only, same caveat; the 10Y gate reads that week's ^TNX |
| Cecil   | **no** | no point-in-time P/E or fundamentals, so only his safety leg is live |

## Run

    python lab/engine_lab.py

Price data is cached in `lab/cache/` (gitignored). Results go to `lab/results/`.

## Pass 1 -- engines as configured 2026-09-21 (9 Council weeks, 2026-07-20 .. 2026-09-14)

| | Mean alpha / wk | Beat SPY | vs random picks | Invested | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Replayed engines | -1.32% (t -2.11) | 2 of 9 | -1.13%/wk, 37th pctile | 97% | -9.2% |
| Real Council | -0.92% (t -2.04) | 2 of 9 | -- | 57% | -5.7% |
| SPY | | | | | +2.4% |
| Equal-weight universe | | | | | +0.9% |

Contribution vs SPY by sponsor, replayed book: Ophelia -7.80%, Marky -2.34%,
Cecil -1.56%. Ophelia's 40-point "last week's top sector" anchor chases one-week
winners into the reversal (MPC/VLO/PSX after energy led, EVRG/NI/AEP after
utilities led, TPR/ABNB/ORLY after discretionary led); the 2026-08-10 book it
drove lost 4.75%, worse than all 200 random draws. The real Council aborted that
week and held cash.
